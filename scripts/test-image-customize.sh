# Real-hardware regression for `fluxvm build-image` via **guestkit only**
# (fluxvm_image::customize_image) — every BuildImageRequest field that mutates
# the guest filesystem: hostname, packages, commands, ssh_key, copy_in,
# enable_services. Never libguestfs / virt-customize / guestfish — guestkit
# mounts with qemu-nbd and runs in chroot, same as production `build-image`.
#
# Proves:
# - `fluxvm build-image` accepts a spec exercising every customization
#   field at once and exits 0
# - hostname is written into /etc/hostname
# - packages actually installs a real package via the guest's own package
#   manager (apt/dnf/tdnf/yum/pacman, auto-detected) — this needs working
#   DNS resolution from inside the chroot, which is not automatic (a stock
#   cloud image's /etc/resolv.conf is normally a dangling symlink); this
#   test would fail loudly if that staging/restore logic regresses
# - commands ran for real (a file it creates is verified to exist)
# - ssh_key lands in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys with 0600 perms
# - copy_in places the exact file contents at the requested destination
# - enable_services actually creates the systemd enablement symlink
# - the resolv.conf staged for package installs is cleaned up afterward,
#   not left behind in the output image
#
# Requires root (qemu-nbd mount) and a base image with a real package
# manager + systemd (the sample cloud images this project already ships
# with all qualify).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/test-image-customize.sh --image /var/lib/fluxvm/images/ubuntu-noble.qcow2
#
# The base image's distro determines which package-manager branch of
# install_packages() actually runs (apt-get/dnf/tdnf/yum/pacman, detected
# live from the image). TEST_PACKAGE/TEST_SERVICE default to Debian/Ubuntu
# names (tree/cron) — override them for other families, e.g.:
#   TEST_SERVICE=crond sudo -E ./scripts/test-image-customize.sh --image rocky9.qcow2   # dnf
#   TEST_SERVICE=cronie sudo -E ./scripts/test-image-customize.sh --image arch.qcow2    # pacman
