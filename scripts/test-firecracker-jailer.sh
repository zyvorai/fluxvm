# Real-hardware regression test for the Firecracker jailer integration
# (config.jailer.enabled, fluxvm-firecracker::launch_jailed). Boots a real
# Firecracker microVM through the actual `jailer` binary.
#
# Proves:
# - the VM actually boots through jailer (kernel/rootfs/config hardlinked
#   or copied into the chroot, referenced by their in-jail paths)
# - the resulting Firecracker process really runs as the configured
#   unprivileged uid/gid, not root (the whole point of the jailer)
# - pause/resume/stop/exec all still work — these go through
#   VmRecord.control_socket, which for a jailed VM points at the
#   chroot-relative API socket path, not the old hardcoded
#   workspace/firecracker.sock
# - delete cleans up both the normal workspace AND the separate jail chroot
#   tree under jailer.chroot_base_dir, with no leftover files or process
#
# Requires a Firecracker-compatible uncompressed kernel and a raw,
# single-partition-extracted rootfs — see README's Firecracker section for
# how those were produced on the real test host this session.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/test-firecracker-jailer.sh \
#       --kernel /var/lib/fluxvm/kernels/vmlinux-fc \
#       --image /var/lib/fluxvm/images/ubuntu-fc-root-agent.raw
