# Real-hardware regression test for warm VM pools (VmManager::create_pool /
# claim_from_pool / delete_pool). Boots real QEMU VMs.
#
# Proves:
# - `fluxvm pool create` (a one-shot CLI process) leaves the pool actually
#   full by the time it exits, not just "eventually, if something else
#   happens to finish the job" (see VmManager::backfill_pool_sync)
# - claiming through the REST API against a running `fluxvm serve` daemon
#   pops a ready member and resumes it MUCH faster than a full create would
#   take (timed against a plain create for comparison)
# - the daemon backfills the pool again after each claim on its own reaper
#   tick, with no further action from the caller
# - two claims in a row hand out two different VMs
# - deleting a pool cleans up every member VM it still owns
#
# Claims specifically go through REST against a running `serve` daemon, NOT
# the bare `fluxvm pool claim` CLI command — `claim_from_pool` fires its
# replenishment off as a background task (see VmManager::spawn_backfill),
# which only actually finishes if the process that started it stays alive.
# Inside `serve` that's true by construction; a one-shot CLI invocation of
# `pool claim` exits right after printing, killing that task mid-flight
# (confirmed on real hardware: it reliably strands a partially-created VM
# outside the pool's own accounting). `pool create` avoids this by blocking
# on backfill_pool_sync before its own process exits — `pool claim`
# deliberately does not, to keep a claim's response fast, which means REST
# through a live daemon is the supported way to claim reliably. This is
# real, current, documented behavior, not a test workaround.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/test-warm-pool.sh --image /var/lib/fluxvm/images/fluxvm-lifecycle-test.qcow2
